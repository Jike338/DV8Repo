<h1>SpaceTime: Interactive Analysis of Spatial Temporal Data at Scale</h1>

<p><a href="/">Back to form</a></p>

<p>The large availability of spatial temporal data (from transportation to mobile usage) brings a unique opportunity to address many interesting tasks such as detecting behavioral patterns, trends, optimizing energy consumption, increasing user satisfaction etc.</p>

<center><img src="figs/diagram.png" width="600px"></img></center>

<p>We are building visual interfaces where users can interact with to get instantaneous insights. Users can interact with data in real-time and observe multiple synchronized visualizations. This project aims to address following challenging questions: how to scale very large spatial temporal datasets for instantaneous interactive visualizations? what is the best set of tools which helps users interact with spatial temporal data? How to keep updated all visualizations during interactions? How to recommend interesting interactions to users?</p>

<p>Spacetime  builds upon the <b>DICE</b> and <b>gestureDB</b> projects, which are ongoing research projects in our group (see "Publications" below). It combines ideas of statistical sampling, speculative execution of queries, large-scale data cube mining and gestural querying to enable an interactive data analytics workflow. Examples of such data analytics are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Planning for the City of Columbus, by combining data streams from crime reports, social media with open / civic datasets. Using historical and real-time spatio-temporal data such as weather information, it is possible to come up with predictive analytical models for "problem areas", and then improve these models over time using observed information as training. By combining these with real-time data feeds from CoGo, COTA, Car2Go and OSU CABS, we can model the impact of transportation in the City, and extract insights into recurring patterns and hot spots.</li>
<li>Shale Exploration: Interactive Analysis of the impact of shale exploration on housing values in Pennsylvania, by combining real-estate pricing, shale exploration reports, and sentiment from surveys and social media.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>SpaceTime is planned to be a 2-year project involving 1 postdoctoral researcher, 2 graduate/undergraduate students and 1 faculty member (Arnab), starting in Fall 2016. The prototype platform will be ready by Spring 2017, with general availability and open sourcing scheduled for Fall 2017.</p>
